  Composer entries for Orchestration Helper - who favoured what, and why.

  Loaded automatically by the main script if it sits alongside it. The script
  works without this file; composers are simply absent.

  Same editorial rule as the main database: cited claims only, and a combination
  a source calls rare or exceptional is never presented as a recommendation.

  A note on what these entries are for. They are not biographies. Each one
  answers a working question: if I want this composer's sound, what did they
  actually put together, and what would I reach for?
